 DRAGONFLY TINDERBOX
=====================

Tinderbox requires a database backend.  You must choose either PostgreSQL
and MySQL.  Selecting the option will only cause the database to be
installed on the system if it's not already.  The actual schema creation
must be done manually per the Tinderbox guide.

The FreeBSD version of Tinderbox allows one to choose between CSUP
(preferred) and CVSUP.  The DragonFly version doesn't give you a choice,
CSUP is used automatically.

The Web Interface makes Tinderbox a whole lot more user-friendly.  The
option causes PHP to be installed.  The user is expected to install the web
server of his choice as a separate exercise and configure it to serve the
directory ${PREFIX}/tinderbox/scripts/webui (usually
/usr/pkg/tinderbox/scripts/webui).

The default configuration of Tinderbox limits execution to the root user. 
Setting the "anybody" option to true will remove this restriction.

Setting the "lsof" option will install the "LiSt Open Files" package
(sysutils/lsof) to gain access to the killMountProcesses functionality when
nullfs is used.  Nullfs is the default; the user will have to configure NFS
manually if that is preferred for chroots.

NOTE: The lsof package is currently broken on DragonFly, so this option has
      been removed from the default list until further notice.
