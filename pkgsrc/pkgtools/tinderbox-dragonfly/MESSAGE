$NetBSD$
pkgtools/tinderbox is installed, but it requires some additional setup.

If tinderbox just installed a database, you'll have to create a
configuration file for it, and move its startup script from
${PREFIX}/share/examples/rc.d to /etc/rc.d

As mentioned in the README file, this package did not install any web
server even though it may have installed a web interface.  Below
describes how to configure some common webservers.

Finally, tinderbox itself has to be configured now, and don't forget
to install tinderd as mentioned above.

****************************************************
Please do read: ${PREFIX}/tinderbox/scripts/README
****************************************************

The following walkthrough is the webserver setup:

- In your Apache configuration add the following lines:

  Alias /tb/logs/ "${PREFIX}/tinderbox/logs/"
  Alias /tb/packages/ "${PREFIX}/tinderbox/packages/"
  Alias /tb/errors/ "${PREFIX}/tinderbox/errors/"
  Alias /tb/wrkdirs/ "${PREFIX}/tinderbox/wrkdirs/"
  Alias /tb/ "${PREFIX}/tinderbox/scripts/webui/"
  <Directory "${PREFIX}/tinderbox/">
      Order allow,deny
      Allow from all
  </Directory>


- In your Lighttpd configuration:

Turn on "mod_alias" and add the following lines:

alias.url = (	"/tb/logs/" => "${PREFIX}/tinderbox/logs/",
		"/tb/packages/" => "${PREFIX}/tinderbox/packages/",
		"/tb/errors/" => "${PREFIX}/tinderbox/errors/",
		"/tb/wrkdirs/" => "${PREFIX}/tinderbox/wrkdirs/",
		"/tb/" => "${PREFIX}/tinderbox/scripts/webui/" )
dir-listing.activate = "enable"


- In your Hiawatha configuration:

Alias is a built in command, no need to load any special mod

Alias = /tb/logs:${PREFIX}/tinderbox/logs
Alias = /tb/packages:${PREFIX}/tinderbox/packages
Alias = /tb/errors:${PREFIX}/tinderbox/errors
Alias = /tb/wrkdirs:${PREFIX}/tinderbox/wrkdirs
Alias = /tb/:${PREFIX}/tinderbox/scripts/webui

  Check your system by going to http://localhost/tb/
