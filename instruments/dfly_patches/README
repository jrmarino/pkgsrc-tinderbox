============================
 GENERATE DRAGONFLY PATCHES
============================

gen_patches.sh

This script will compare the DragonFly files, which are overlays, to the
original FreeBSD files and create NetBSD-style patches from them.  If there
are no differences, which can happen if bugs get fixed upstream and pulled
in, then the patch will be deleted.  Advice to remove the identical overlay
will also be given.

After all the patches are created, a new distinfo file will be generated. 
The /usr/pkgsrc/pkgtools/tinderbox-dragonfly pkg has to be in a clean state,
otherwise pkgsrc will ignore the "bmake distinfo" command.  As a bonus, the
packages patches directory receives the new patches as well.

patch.map

There is a permanent coupling between patch ID (e.g. aa, ab, ac) and a
specific file.  Each line in this data file means that the indicated file
was different in the past, if not still different.  If there is no longer
an overlay, then the line will be skipped and no patch made.  Never re-use
a patch ID, just keep added new lines with unique ids.
